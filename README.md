‚òëÔ∏è end-to-end testing of web applications and websites

‚òëÔ∏è component testing in isolation (React / Vue / Storybook / Angular)

‚òëÔ∏è Node.js unit, visual regression testing, accessibility testing & API testing

‚òëÔ∏è Native mobile app testing on Android & iOS


## About Mentorship

As Nightwatch.js turns 10 this year, we plan to make Nightwatch.js more open and welcoming to the contributions from the amazing
Open Source community, starting with getting involved into various Open Source mentorship programs. This would not only help
Nightwatch.js grow as the community around the testing space grows, but would also benefit the testers and developers around
the globe with new and better capabilities to do their testing.

## Getting Involved üöÄ

To get involved with the various mentorship programs under Nightwatch.js, join our [Discord server][discord] and express your interest
or ask away any doubts in the __#general__ or __#development-team__ channels.
