* Start as early as possible and try to submit at least a few good code contributions to Nightwatch.js project before submitting your proposal. so that we can be sure that you'll be a good fit for the project.
* Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SN8Da2X) and make sure to interact with the mentors and discuss your solution and approach towards a project idea with them before starting to fill in the proposal.
* Share the first draft of your proposal as early as possible.
* Share the proposal link as text, markdown, Google docs or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
