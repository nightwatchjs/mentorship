# Contributor Guidance for GSoC 2024

## General guidelines

* Read the [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) written by the Google Summer of Code organizers.
* Understand the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), application process and the project you are applying for, assuming best intentions throughout the period.
* Start as early as possible and try to submit at least a few good code contributions to Nightwatch.js project before submitting your proposal, so that we can be sure that you'll be a good fit for the project.
* Other form of contributions like helping out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SN8Da2X), [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/issues), and reviewing pull requests are also most welcomed. We'd prefer contributors who can not only contribute to the codebase of Nightwatch.js but can also contribute to the community around it.
* Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SN8Da2X) and make sure to reach out and interact with the mentors to discuss your solution and approach towards a project idea before starting to fill in the proposal.
* Share the first draft of your proposal as early as possible.
* Share the proposal link as text, markdown, Google docs or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
* Final proposals should be submitted on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline and after all the reviews have been done.

## Writing your proposal

* Your proposal should contain a clear understanding on how you're going to approach the project idea, along with a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it.

### Project plan

>
> Project plan should ideally be the most extensive portion of your proposal so make sure you define the solution for the problem you proposed above. It should clearly depict your understanding towards the project and how you plan to approach it.

### Schedule of Deliverables

> Document all your milestones, neatly divided into the various phases: before community bonding, during community bonding, Phase-1, Phase-2 and more. Each phase should be further divided into week-wise manner and sub-tasks should be added for all your deliverables to help mentors better understand the time estimate and if they are in accordance with the GSoC timeline.
