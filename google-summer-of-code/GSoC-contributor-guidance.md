# Contributor Guidance for GSoC 2024

## General guidelines

* Read the [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) written by the Google Summer of Code organizers.
* Go through the [GSoC 2024 Project Ideas List](GSoC-2024-Ideas.md) for Nightwatch.js and read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Understand the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), application process and the project you are applying for, assuming best intentions throughout the period.
* Start as early as possible and try to submit at least a few good code contributions to any project of your liking in the [Nighwatch.js GitHub Org](https://github.com/nightwatchjs) before submitting your proposal, so that we can be sure that you have what it takes to be a good Nightwatch.js contributor.
* Other form of contributions like helping out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SN8Da2X), [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/issues), and reviewing pull requests are also most welcomed. We'd prefer contributors who can not only contribute to the codebase of Nightwatch.js but can also contribute to the community around it.
* Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SN8Da2X) and make sure to reach out and interact with the mentors to discuss your solution and approach towards a project idea before starting to fill in the proposal.
* Share the first draft of your proposal as early as possible.
* Share the proposal link as text, markdown, Google docs or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
* Final proposals should be submitted on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline and after all the reviews have been done.

## Writing your proposal

* Your proposal should contain a clear understanding on how you're going to approach the project idea, along with a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it.
* If you plan to propose your own project idea, please include a project outline, goals (as done in [Ideas List](GSoC-2024-Ideas.md)) and a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it.
